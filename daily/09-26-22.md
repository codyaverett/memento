# Enrolling for college

- Today I have to request transcripts from my previous two colleges
- Brush up on some maths

## Starting is the hardest part

It's a struggle to get out of bed some days.  I feel tired a lot.  Heavy eyes in the morning, wide awake at night.

I'm usually good to go as soon as I finish my morning routine/rituals.
