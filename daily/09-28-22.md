# Daily coding!

Have done a lot of coding challenges today in order to prepare for a coding challenge I will have to do within the next day or so.

I need to practice more with Python's functional style data structures and helpers like Map, Reduce, Filter, etc.
Basically all the things I'd normally use with Javascript.
