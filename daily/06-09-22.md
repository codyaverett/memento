## Elixir and Erlang
I think these are fascinating technology stacks.  They resurfaced in my life after reading through what [supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/overview) has going on.

## React Query
Would like to understand how [react query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/queries) works a little better

## Ergo react dapp connector
Stumbled across this react component by the Night Owl casino folks
https://github.com/Filsommer/react-ergo-payments

Allows you to more easily integrate Ergo into a website.

## Interesting React Library @headlessui/react
Some of the components like Menu and Combo boxes are really interesting to use.

I still enjoy AriaKit/Reakit though for how styling can be overridden
