# Friday
## Work
- worked on deploying our email project containers to our development environment
- wished I had a better way to manage our deployments, a lot of the changes are automated, but there are still some manual steps that causes new application deployments to be kinda difficult
- Going to continue to work with Cody on Monday to figure out what is left to do

## Interesting Cardano Project
- [Lucid Dream](https://www.cardanocube.io/projects/lucid-dream) - mental health awareness

## Cross platform desktop applications
### benefits
- usually cheaper because one person can fulfill the job of 3 in terms of development.  One VS an IOS developer, Android developer, Backend developer
- simpler and less coding

### difficulties
- sometimes more difficult to get to native features
