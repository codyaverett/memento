There are other implementations of python (like how javascript has different runtimes)
- CPython is the main
- Jython is python implemented in java
- IronPython is python implemented in C#
- PyPy is a subset of Python

### CPython
If you have code written in C, you convert the C code into machine code

### JavaByteCode
Compile to JavaByteCode and JVM converts into machine code

Python takes a similar approach
Python > CPython > PythonByteCode > PythonVirtualMachine > MachineCode

### Jython
Converts Python into java bytecode that is executed by the java virtual machine

### Autocompletion

### Code Formatting
There is a document for python code formatting standards
[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

### Unit Testing

### Code Snippets
