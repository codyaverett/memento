# forgetting what you read after you read it
"Reasons reap results"
"Genius leaves clues"
"Names you remember; you remember because there is some intention behind it"
"All behavior is belief driven"

Reading slow impacts reading comprehension.
Reading quickly improves your focus.

## 3 questions to ask about what you are reading
1. How can I use this? 
	- While reading or learning, ask yourself all the time: how can I use this information? How can I apply this?
	- Where you put your focus is where your attention and then action will flow.

2. Why must I use this?
	- Success formula, HQ: head to your heart to your hands --- you can have knowledge in your head, but nothing will change unless you use your hands and act.
	- The answer to this question will give you the energy to pursue action.
	- We're emotional creatures, so ask yourself why you must do something and you'll be more likely to get it done! If you can't think of a reason why you must, chances are you won't apply it.

	- Consider all the benefits of applying the knowledge.
	- Remember: reasons reap results.
	- You might be acquiring lots of knowledge, through books, seminars etc, but not achieving potential. One reason for you might be: you want to be congruent with your life!
	- Remember: better well done than well said! Show it to yourself, and your family, rather than telling them!
	- The biggest lie is "knowledge is power"
	- Books on shelves aren't useful innately. 
	- Apply what you learn.

3. When will I use this?
	- Doesn't become real until you put it in your calendar
	- Your calendar is an incredible productivity tool!
	- Treat it as time incredibly well invested, and protect that time like you would time with your boss or family --- things you wouldn't compromise on.
	- Remember: self-care and self-love are not selfish.
	- Look after yourself first so you're not seeking validation from others, so you can generate this internally and don't need outside stimulus to do what you want to do --- if you can generate your motivation on your own, you'll start doing it because it's who you are.
