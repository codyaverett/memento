# Prompt for prompts

Something like this is useful for quickly creating specialized LLM prompts to test out.
The more context the LLMs have, the more focused and less cookie-cutter your results will seem.

```
Give me a chatGPT prompt where we can have a conversation with someone about their PTSD and help them move past certain mental blockers they might have.
```
