# Today Was Thursday

- Got into the office a little later today
- Worked with Cody on our email project

Crypto market cap is looking like it may have bottomed out already.  The weekly chart looks good to me right now.

- Green dot in market cipher

## Elixir and Erlang
I think these are fascinating technology stacks.  They resurfaced in my life after reading through what [supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/overview) has going on.

## React Query
Would like to understand how [react query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/queries) works a little better

## Ergo React Dapp Connector
Stumbled across this react component by the Night Owl casino folks
https://github.com/Filsommer/react-ergo-payments

Allows you to more easily integrate Ergo into a website.

## Interesting React Library @headlessui/react
Some of the components like Menu and Combo boxes are really interesting to use.

I still enjoy [AriaKit/Reakit](https://github.com/ariakit/ariakit) though for how styling can be overridden and its overall utility.

## Fear and Greed Index
- Account that posts the Fear and greed Index every day. https://twitter.com/BitcoinFear?s=20&t=xtsC1RKc-o5F3H0nHXLSZQ

Generally, it's good to buy when others are fearful and bad time to sell.
