# Another Day Down

Some days are harder than others to find something to do.  I mean, there are lots of things that I could do, but I don't always have the energy to actually do anything on the list.

## Metro 2033
Started playing metro again.  Interesting story

## Potion Permit
Heather is officially farther in the game than I am now.  She took today off to play it some more.

## Planning
I need to prepare a little bit for an interview I have tomorrow.  Need to clean up my office/desk too.
