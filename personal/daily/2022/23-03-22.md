Today was our last day skiing with Jimi O.  Had a blast! Learned some new tricks, did some blue rated routes and gained a lot of confidence in our skiing abilities.

I may have gotten a little sunburnt today on my face after today.

Need to decide on if we are going to be skiing tomorrow, but I think we are going to do some runs in the morning tomorrow and take Friday off.
