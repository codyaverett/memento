Yesterday we drove to Denver
I was tired most of the day, but thankfully Heather's dad was able to help me drive here.

It's starting to feel like a vacation already.
We are at a Hilton for the night. I like staying at hotels.

Today we will probably explore around Denver a bit and head towards Dillon closer to 2pm.
