## Low level coding
I have some super nerdy stuff for you here today!
Beware, there be dragons! :dragon: 

Python was written in the C programming language, it's interesting to read about how you can run C compiled code from python

C is a really good language to have a general understanding of btw.  It is really low level and doesn't have all the bells and whistles newer programming languages have.  You have to do a lot of things yourself.

Beyond that you would need to look at Assembly programming (Assemblers)
I did a little bit of this stuff when I was learning programming for my TI-84 plus calculator

Beyond that you are literally typing 1s and 0s

## When the python interpreter starts up

It's interesting to understand what the python interpreter does before it runs your code

It sets variables like `__name__` before the first line of your file executes
