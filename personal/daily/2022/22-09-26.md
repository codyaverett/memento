# Enrolling for College

- Today I have to request transcripts from my previous two colleges
- Brush up on some maths
- Start a pre-cal course on khan academy

## Starting is the Hardest Part

It's a struggle to get out of bed some days.  I feel tired a lot.  Heavy eyes in the morning, wide awake at night.

I'm usually good to go as soon as I finish my morning routine/rituals.

## Things to Work on This Week

- Review more python code and django
- Bass guitar course
- Calculus / Maths
- Potion Permit game
- Set up more interviews through linkedIn and apply for more jobs

## Things to Prep for This Week

- Interview on Wednesday at 10am
- Other interviews
- Taking care of Nickel and Penny later on in the week.
- Clean up the office room and desks

## Idea

Service to verify service performed on a vehicle
- Pull up all the service records .. transfer the service records along with the asset.
Approach new car lots
If someone is interested in keeping records, they could use this technology
- How would you easily store service records? 
  
  Online site to see the service records?

It's gotta add value
Reading information
Storing information - adding to records
Transferring records to others
