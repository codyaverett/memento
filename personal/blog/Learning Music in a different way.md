# Learning Music in a Different Way

Have you ever tried to learn music theory and found it to be a challenging and overwhelming experience? Do you struggle to understand concepts such as scales, chords, and keys? Perhaps you feel like you're not naturally "musically inclined" and that music theory is just not for you. If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Many people find music theory to be a complex and daunting subject, and it's not uncommon for beginners to feel discouraged or intimidated by the amount of information they need to learn.

But don't give up just yet! While music theory can be complex, there are simpler and more accessible ways to approach it. With the right resources and approach, anyone can learn music theory and gain a better understanding of the music they love. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the common challenges people face when learning music theory, and discuss some alternative methods that can make the process easier and more enjoyable.

## What is Music Theory

Music theory is the study of the structure, elements, and principles of music. It's an essential part of understanding how music works, and it's used by composers, performers, and music educators to create and teach music. Learning music theory can be a challenging but rewarding process that requires time, dedication, and practice.

To begin, a good place to start is with the basics of music theory, which includes concepts such as rhythm, melody, harmony, and form. As you progress, you'll learn about more advanced topics like scales, modes, chords, and key signatures. Practice is key when it comes to learning music theory, as it involves both intellectual and creative processes. With time and effort, you can develop a solid foundation in music theory that will not only improve your musical skills but also enhance your appreciation and enjoyment of music.

## Reading and Writing Music

There are various ways in which musical ideas can be written and read, with different notations used depending on the type of music and the cultural context. Western classical music, for example, is typically notated using sheet music, which includes staves, clefs, notes, rests, and other symbols that indicate the pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and articulation of the music. Jazz music, on the other hand, often uses lead sheets, which are simplified musical scores that provide basic melody, chord, and rhythm information, and leave room for improvisation and personal interpretation.

In addition to sheet music and lead sheets, there are other forms of notation used in various styles of music around the world. For example, in Indian classical music, a system of notation called "sargam" is used, which represents each note using a syllable, such as "sa", "re", "ga", "ma", "pa", "dha", and "ni". In traditional African music, notation is often based on a combination of symbols, such as dots, lines, and arrows, that indicate the rhythm and phrasing of the music.

Regardless of the type of notation used, the goal is always to accurately convey the musical ideas and intentions of the composer or performer, and to allow others to read and interpret the music in their own way. The different notations used in music reflect the diversity and richness of musical traditions around the world, and provide insight into the unique cultural contexts in which they were created.

## Make up Our Own Notation

Have you ever found yourself humming a melody or tapping out a rhythm but struggled to notate it using traditional music notation? Or perhaps you're a musician looking for a more personal and expressive way to write down your musical ideas? In such cases, creating your own musical notation can be a helpful and liberating experience. By developing a personal system of symbols and notation, you can capture and communicate your musical ideas in a way that feels natural and intuitive to you. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the benefits and challenges of creating your own musical notation, and provide some tips and strategies to help you get started.

One way to create your own musical notation using numbers is to use a system of numbered intervals. Intervals are the distance between two notes, and are typically described using terms such as "minor third" or "perfect fifth". By assigning a number to each interval, you can create a simple and intuitive notation system that can be used to notate melodies, chords, and other musical ideas.

For example, you could assign the number 1 to the first note of a melody, and then use numbers to indicate the interval between each subsequent note. A "minor third" interval, for instance, could be represented by the number 3, while a "perfect fifth" could be represented by the number 5. Using this system, you can quickly and easily notate melodies and other musical ideas without having to learn complex music notation.

Another approach is to use numbers to represent specific pitches or notes. In this system, each note is assigned a specific number or series of numbers that represents its pitch. For example, you could use the numbers 1-12 to represent the 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale, with 1 representing C, 2 representing C#, and so on. This notation system is similar to the MIDI system mentioned earlier, and can be useful for notating music that is performed or created using digital instruments or software.

Regardless of the system you choose, the key is to find a notation system that works for you and allows you to capture and communicate your musical ideas in a way that feels natural and intuitive. With a little experimentation and creativity, you can develop a personalized musical notation system that reflects your unique style and musical perspective.

### Associating Numbers to Notes

| Number | Notes with Sharps | Notes with Flats |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | A   | A   |
| 2   | A#/Bb   | Bb/A# |
| 3   | B   | B   |
| 4   | C   | C   |
| 5   | C#/Db   | Db/C# |
| 6   | D   | D   |
| 7   | D#/Eb   | Eb/D# |
| 8   | E   | E   |
| 9   | F   | F   |
| 10  | F#/Gb   | Gb/F# |
| 11  | G   | G   |
| 12  | G#/Ab   | Ab/G# |

## Triads

In music theory, a triad is a chord consisting of three notes, usually the root, third, and fifth of a scale. There are 12 different notes in Western music, so we have 12 choices for the root note of the triad.

Once we have chosen the root note, we have 11 remaining notes to choose from for the second note of the triad. However, we can only choose notes that are a third or a fifth away from the root note to form a proper triad, so we have 2 choices for the second note.

Finally, once we have chosen the first and second notes of the triad, we have only one remaining note that can be chosen to complete the triad.

Therefore, the total number of possible combinations of triads is:

12 (choices for the root note) x 2 (choices for the second note) x 1 (choice for the third note) = 24.

So there are 24 different possible triads in Western music theory.

## Guitar Tunings

There are a few ways to list out all the notes.  Both flat and sharp values are allowed, but it's simpler to use just one form or the other.

### A Key for Our Notes

In the table where each musical note is replaced with a number, the key for the numbers is that each note is mapped to a unique integer between 0 and 11. The mapping is as follows:

| Note | Number |
| --- | --- |
| A   | 0   |
| A#  | 1   |
| B   | 2   |
| C   | 3   |
| C#  | 4   |
| D   | 5   |
| D#  | 6   |
| E   | 7   |
| F   | 8   |
| F#  | 9   |
| G   | 10  |
| G#  | 11  |

For example, in the table, the note E on the 1st string (top string) is replaced with the number 4, which corresponds to the note A# in the key. Similarly, the note B on the 2nd string is replaced with the number 2, which corresponds to the note B in the key.
