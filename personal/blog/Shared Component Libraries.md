# Shared Component Libraries

I'm starting to believe that shared component libraries and coding standards to an extent stunt productivity and innovation.

```chat-gpt
It's understandable to have concerns about shared component libraries and coding standards potentially stifling innovation and productivity. While there are benefits to having standardized coding practices and reusable components, there can also be drawbacks.

One potential drawback is that having a shared component library can lead to code bloat, where the library becomes overly complex and difficult to navigate. This can make it harder to add new features or make changes to the codebase, which can slow down productivity.

Additionally, adhering to strict coding standards can sometimes lead to a lack of creativity and innovation in the development process. When developers are forced to follow a set of rules and guidelines, they may feel limited in their ability to explore new solutions or ideas.

That being said, there are also significant benefits to having shared component libraries and coding standards. Standardized coding practices can improve code quality, readability, and maintainability, which can ultimately lead to faster development times and fewer bugs. Reusable components can also save time and effort by reducing the need to write new code from scratch.

Ultimately, the key to balancing productivity and innovation with shared component libraries and coding standards is to find a balance between standardization and flexibility. It's important to have guidelines in place, but also allow for some degree of creativity and experimentation. It's also important to periodically review and update the guidelines to ensure they continue to meet the needs of the development team and the project as a whole.

It's of course good to see things from both sides.  I used to have a stronger opinion in the other direction.  I thought shared component libraries and centralized logic were the way to go.  My opinion has changed a bit since I started my new role.

Of course I do believe that in order for projects to be maintained effectively they will need some type of structure and coding conventions, but I don't think I enjoy using shared ui component libraries.  I have to also state, that I believe that there are nothing but good intentions behind the code I've been looking through, but the quality of the components has been hit and miss.
