# People Just Do Not Know What They Do Not Know

People of all skill levels don't know what they do not know.  Sounds obvious, right?

Given that new programmers don't generally know a lot about programming, they would likely need help finding a starting point.  Everything gets easier after you get started.

This is the reason I like skill maps and things of that nature.

e.g. 
I know that I need to learn maths better.  Let me find the limits of what I know and understand now and see what branches off from what I already know.

My good friend shared this amazing content library visualization with me a while back.  Check it out and play with it a bit!

There is also the cursed iceburg meme.

Some quick ideas on the topic

- It's easy to get overwhelmed with so many options out there.
- It's important to know what is not important so you can focus only on the parts that matter to you in the present.
- Learn what knowledge is important for what you want to do.
- Learn what knowledge is related to the knowledge you need to know.
- Create notes for everything you learn and do!  I use obsidian.md now, but I used to just use paper and pencil!
- For coding specifically, Free Code camp is great if you don't know where to start https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn. Pick one of their learning paths and get to it!
