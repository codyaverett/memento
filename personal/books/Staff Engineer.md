# Leadership beyond the management track

Moving up the ladder in your technical career will lead to you having less time to work on more challenging problems.

Staff Engineer job functions typically overlap with engineer director roles.

## Work on what matters 
- p.35
- Different types of work are valued by different types of organizations
- Focus on the work that matters to your organization and to yourself
- Being the "glue" in your organization is not typically valued because it is less tangible than changes actually happening
- Important work sometimes goes unnoticed because leadership does not value all work the same.  It varies from leader to leader.
	- e.g. Improving developer experience and tooling to improve overall development throughput
	- e.g. Glue work, making sure teams are aligned on common goals
	- e.g. Introducing new technologies
	- e.g. Tightly coupling modules
	- e.g. Automated testing
- Sometimes a failing app is one code change away from being a success

## Write an engineering strategy
- p.43
- To write an engineering strategy:
	- Write five design documents, and pull the similarities out.
- To write an engineering vision:
	- Write five engineering strategies, and forecast their implications two years into the future.
- Leave all your "most brilliant" ideas out of these documents
