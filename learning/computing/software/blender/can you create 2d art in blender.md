# Can You Create 2d Art in Blender

Yes, you can create 2D SVG art in Blender. Blender is a 3D modeling and animation software that also has some 2D capabilities. To create 2D SVG art in Blender, you can use the 2D drawing and text tools to create vector shapes and text.

To create a new 2D SVG file in Blender, select "New" from the "File" menu and choose the "SVG" option under the "Vectors" category. This will create a new 2D SVG file in Blender with a single layer. You can then use the 2D drawing tools, such as the "Draw" tool, the "Circle" tool, and the "Polygon" tool, to draw vector shapes on the canvas. You can also use the "Text" tool to add text to your SVG file.

To adjust the properties of your 2D SVG art, such as the stroke width and color, you can use the "Properties" panel on the right side of the screen. You can also use the "Transform" tools to move, rotate, and scale your vector shapes and text.

When you are finished creating your 2D SVG art in Blender, you can save it by selecting "Save As" from the "File" menu and choosing the "SVG" file format. You can then open the saved SVG file in any software that supports the SVG format, such as a web browser or a vector graphics editor.
