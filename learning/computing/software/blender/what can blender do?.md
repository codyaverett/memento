# What Can Blender Do?

Blender is a powerful and versatile 3D graphics software that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including:

Modeling: Blender allows you to create 3D models of objects and characters, using a variety of modeling tools and techniques.

Animation: Blender has a comprehensive set of tools for creating animations, including keyframes, curves, and physics simulations.

Rendering: Blender can produce high-quality images and videos through its rendering engine, which supports features such as global illumination, ambient occlusion, and subsurface scattering.

Compositing: Blender has a built-in compositing system that allows you to combine multiple images or video clips together, add special effects, and create a final composite.

Simulation: Blender can simulate a variety of physical phenomena, including fluid dynamics, soft body dynamics, and particle systems.

Video editing: Blender includes a non-linear video editor that allows you to import, trim, and arrange video clips, add transitions and effects, and output the final result.

Overall, Blender is a comprehensive tool that can be used for a wide range of 3D graphics tasks, from creating simple models and animations to producing professional-quality images and videos.
