# Meme Coins

1. Monitor performance: Keep an eye on which meme coins are performing well. DEXToolsApp is a great resource for tracking top gainers and measuring which memes are gaining momentum from a price perspective.

2. Verify culture: Strong community is essential for the success of any meme coin. Look for memes that are funny, entertaining, and easy to understand. You can track social metrics on LunarCrush or check if the token is being talked about on Twitter, Telegram, Discord, or is trending on Twitter, Google, DexTools or CoinGecko.

3. Research fundamentals: Find out who the team behind the meme coin is, their level of competence, and what the tokenomics are like. Although these questions are often less important when researching meme coins, they can still create an edge and help avoid rugs and exploits. Running an audit on Token_Sniffer and assessing the distribution of wallets on bubblemaps can also help reduce risk.

4. Decide whether to follow the leader or play the rotation game: Consider investing in the leader of a certain niche, like DOGE for Inu coins or PEPE for Frog coins. New liquidity often gravitates towards the leader first, then flows down into smaller coins in that niche. Alternatively, you can try to play the rotation game and invest in smaller caps that emerge underneath a niche leader. While this can result in some nice gains, it may not be the best risk/reward play.

5. Follow the smart money: Look at what successful meme coin traders are buying and consider following their lead.
