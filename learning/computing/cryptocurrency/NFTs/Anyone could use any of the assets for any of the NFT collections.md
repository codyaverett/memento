Ownership of items in game would be provisioned if the user owns the NFT in their connected wallet.  Or if they can prove that they have ownership of the item.

Properties of a token
* Soulbound
* Bound by persona
* Delegate nft tokens (a NFT that points to another NFT)
	* Perhaps the owner of the NFT should need to mint and give specific permissions to the delegate custodian holder.
	* Owner should not need to give custody of the NFT to the other account.
	* Owner should be allowed to delegate ownership to one or multiple accounts
