# Http Protocol

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a widely used protocol for transferring data across the internet, and it has a number of features that are not well known or widely used. Here are a few examples:

## Lesser Known Features of Http

HTTP headers: HTTP headers are name-value pairs that can be used to provide additional information about a request or response, such as the content type, encoding, language, and caching behavior. Some headers, such as "Referer" and "User-Agent," are widely used, but others, such as "X-Frame-Options" and "X-XSS-Protection," are less well known.

HTTP methods: HTTP defines a set of methods that can be used to request information from a server or send data to a server. The most commonly used methods are GET, POST, and HEAD, but there are several others, including PUT, DELETE, and TRACE, that are not as widely used.

HTTP authentication: HTTP includes support for authentication, allowing a server to challenge a client to provide credentials before granting access to protected resources. This can be implemented using the "WWW-Authenticate" and "Authorization" headers, but it is not commonly used due to the prevalence of other authentication methods, such as OAuth and SAML.

HTTP cookies: HTTP cookies are a mechanism for storing small pieces of information on the client side that can be used to maintain state or track user activity. While cookies are widely used, some of their more advanced features, such as the ability to specify expiration dates and domain restrictions, are not as well known.

HTTP caching: HTTP includes support for caching, allowing clients and servers to store responses locally to reduce the need for repeat requests. This can be controlled using a variety of headers, including "Cache-Control" and "Expires," but the details of how caching works and how to effectively use it can be complex and are not always well understood.
