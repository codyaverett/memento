# Protocols for Transferring Data Over Networks

There are several methods of transmitting data over the internet that are known for their efficiency. These include:

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): This is a standard protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It is known for its reliability, as it ensures that data is delivered to its destination without errors by using a system of acknowledgments and retransmissions.

- UDP (User Datagram Protocol): This is a simpler protocol than TCP, and it is known for its speed. It does not include the error-checking and retransmission features of TCP, which makes it faster but less reliable.

- [[http protocol]] (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): This is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet, specifically for transferring web pages and other related content. It is used by web browsers to communicate with web servers and request content.

- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): This is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data transmitted over the internet. It is commonly used for online transactions and other sensitive communications.

- FTP (File Transfer Protocol): This is a standard protocol used for transferring files over the internet. It is often used for transferring large files or groups of files.

- SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol): This is a secure version of FTP that uses encryption to protect data transmitted over the internet. It is commonly used for transferring sensitive files or for accessing remote servers securely.
