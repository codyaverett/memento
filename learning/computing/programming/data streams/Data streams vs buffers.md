# Data Streams Vs Buffers

- Buffers process data at the expense of system memory
- Streams process data as it is received which reduces the memory overhead for each

## Streaming Challenges
- If the producer streams more data than the consumer can process in a span of time, the consumer will start to take up memory
- If a consumer system dies in the middle of a data stream you'd need to have a way to start the process back up without duplicating work
- Too many producers/consumers can turn the system into a tightly coupled monolith

## Streaming is Amazing Though
- "Perhaps itâ€™s not surprising that when streams become the center of the world, everything is streamlined."
