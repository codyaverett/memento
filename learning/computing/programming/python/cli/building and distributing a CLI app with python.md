# building and distributing a CLI app with python

Many Python packages include command line tools. This is useful for distributing support tools which are associated with a library, or just taking advantage of the setuptools / PyPI infrastructure to distribute a command line tool that happens to use Python.

## Distribution
- Deploy to Pypy the public repository or the PyPy Test net
