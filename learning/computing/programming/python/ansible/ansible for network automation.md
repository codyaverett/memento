# Ansible for network automation

So, this next thing I'll share might seem quite overwhelming, so feel free to not learn much about it, but it's a very very powerful automation tool that happens to be written in python.  It's called Ansible.

We use Ansible at walmart to automate anything from application deployments, server configurations, and also automated network updates.

Here is the basics/Networking intro section.
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/basic_concepts.html

I think learning python and how networks actually work and operate should come before learning an automation framework.  People out there in the industry use Ansible though, so it's good to keep in mind.

There may be some other tools i'm not aware of, so please share any interesting tools you come across with me.

I referenced ansible above briefly too actually. lol go me

One more thing about ansible.  People out there have already published tons of "playbooks" related to tons of things.

Here are some Cisco specific ones, click through to see what all people have made configurable in cisco networking devices

And here is a list of all the other things +cisco stuff

I'm actually decent at Ansible, but I had underdeveloped python skills while I was using it.
Had I known what I now know about python I would have had a much simpler time with it.
