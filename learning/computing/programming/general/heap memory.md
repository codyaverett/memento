# Heap Memory

- Memory stored in the heap is accessible by all the treads of a program
- Developers can allocate and deallocate memory in the heap memory.
- Memory not cleaned up by the program is called a memory leak
- Objects created will be stored in the heap memory and references to the memory locations will be stored in the stack.  (Passing by value or passing by reference)
