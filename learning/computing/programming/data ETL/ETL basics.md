# ETL basics

## Load the data
Get data from various sources

## Types of Transformations
* Aggregation
* Normalization

## Tools for ETL processes
- Apache Nifi (seen this before, we almost used at walmart)
- Informatica
- Talend
- Microsoft SSIS
- Apache Airflow (job runner/orchestrator, but people use it in ETL processes)

## Data Warehouse software
A simple database can typically be used, but there are enterprise focused Data warehouse softwares that can be used instead.

- Teradata (used this at walmart before we transitioned to hadoop and datalake)
- Amazon Redshift
- Snowflake
- Greenplum
