# Make It Stick

1. Learning requires memory
2. We need to keep learning and remembering all of our lives 
3. Learning is an acquired skill and the most effective strategies are often counterintuitive 

## Claims Made in the Book

- We are poor judges of when we are learning well and when we're not.
- Rereading text is one of the least productive learning methods
- Periodic practice arrests forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain.
- All new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge.
- Elaboration is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know.
- People who learn to extract the key ideas from new material and organize them into a mental model and connect that model to prior knowledge show an advantage in learning complex mastery.
- A mental model is a mental representation of some external reality
- Every-time you learn something new, you change your brain
- Failure is a badge of effort and a source of useful information --- the need to understand that when learning is hard, you're doing important work.
- Making mistakes and correcting them builds the bridges to advanced
- The best empirical studies are experimental in nature - p.9
- When learning is harder, it's stronger and lasts longer
- Rereading is time consuming.  It doesn't result in durable memory.  And it often involves a kind of unwitting self-deception, as growing familiarity with the text comes to feel like mastery of the content - p.10
- Spaced out exposure and connection of ideas and thoughts with practice lead to the best learning
