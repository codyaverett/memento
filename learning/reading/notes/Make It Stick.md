1. Learning requires memory
2. We need to keep learning and remembering all of our lives 
3. Learning is an acquired skill and the most effective strategies are often counterintuitive 

## Claims made in the book

- We are poor judges of when we are learning well and when we're not.
- Rereading text is one of the least productive learning methods
- Periodic practice arrests forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain.
- All new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge.
- Elaboration is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know.
- People who learn to extract the key ideas from new material and organize them into a mental model and connect that model to prior knowledge show an advantage in learning complex mastery.
- A mental model is a mental representation of some external reality
- Every-time you learn something new, you change your brain
- Failure is a badge of effort and a source of useful information --- the need to understand that when learning is hard, you're doing important work.
- Making mistakes and correcting them builds the bridges to advanced
- The best empirical studies are experimental in nature - p.9
- When learning is harder, it's stronger and lasts longer
- Rereading is time consuming.  It doesn't result in durable memory.  And it often involves a kind of unwitting self-deception, as growing familiarity with the text comes to feel like mastery of the content - p.10
- Spaced out exposure and connection of ideas and thoughts with practice lead to the best learning
