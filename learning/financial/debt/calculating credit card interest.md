# Calculating Credit Card Interest

## Monthly APR

1. Find your current APR and current balance in your credit card statement.
2. Divide your current APR by 12 (for the twelve months of the year) to find your monthly periodic rate.
3. Divide your periodic rate by 100 and then multiply that number with the amount of your current balance to see how much interest you will accrue each month.

e.g.

```
Account at 10,000 with 25.99% interest

Divide 25.99 by 12 = 2.165833

Divide that amount by 100 to get a percent which is 0.02165833

Multiply 10,000 by 0.02165833 to get a monthly interest of 693.0666
```


## Daily APR

1. Find your current APR and current balance in your credit card statement.
2. Divide your APR rate by 365 (for the 365 days in the year) to find your daily periodic rate.
3. Multiply your current balance by your daily periodic rate.

## Example

If the steps above seem confusing, here's an example of how to calculate APR charge on a credit card:
If your current balance is $500 for the entire month and your APR rate is 17.99%, you can find your daily periodic rate by dividing your current APR by 365. In this case, your daily APR would be approximately 0.0492%. By multiplying $500 by 0.00049, you'll find your daily periodic rate is $0.25. In order to calculate the monthly interest charges to your balance you simply need to multiply this daily periodic rate by the number of days in your billing cycle. For most credit cards the average billing cycle is about 30 days.

With this in mind, it is prudent to keep on top of payments each month in order to minimize this effect of daily compounding interest.

The steps above will put you on the right path to not only learning how to calculate APR on a credit card, it will also assist you in learning how to use your credit card efficiently. 

## Why Should I Know My Daily and Monthly APR?

Your credit card balance can fluctuate on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. By calculating your daily and monthly APR, you can better understand how much of your money is going to interest. Understanding how much of your money is going to interest rather than your balance may also motivate you to pay off your debt or help you decide what purchases are worth putting on the credit card. By breaking down your interest rates on a daily and monthly basis, you can learn more about the interest you are accruing over time and use this information to make some of your financial decisions.
