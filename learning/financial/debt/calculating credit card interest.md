# calculating credit card interest

1. Find your current APR and current balance in your credit card statement.
2. Divide your current APR by 12 (for the twelve months of the year) to find your monthly periodic rate.
3. Multiply that number with the amount of your current balance.

e.g.

Card at 10,000 with 25.99% interest

Divide 25.99 by 12 = 2.165833

Multiply 10,000 by 2.165833
