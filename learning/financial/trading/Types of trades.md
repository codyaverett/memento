# Types of Trades

## Scalping
Scalping is all about making very quick trades. The goal is to make constant profits on the lower timeframes.

## Day Trading
It is like scalping, but instead of making trades over the course of minutes, you typically make them over the course of the day.

## Intraday Trading
This is day trading, but a style of day trading that allows for holding positions over more than one day to hit your desired targets.

## Swing Trading
Swing trading is all about finding support and trading to the next resistance level, or more generally picking an entry and a target and holding the position until your target is hit or other exit conditions are met.

## Position Trading
Position trading is like a zoomed-out version of swing trading or like the trading version of investing. Here youâ€™ll try to build/take a long position low or short position high and then stick with that position for weeks, months, or even years.
