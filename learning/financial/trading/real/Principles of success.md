# Principles of Success

- Gambling will not get you rich
- Skills require effort
- Investing multiplies existing monies

## Economic Seasons

- Crypto is highly related to other assets in the world

![[Pasted image 20230421063606.png]]

The four economic seasons.
- Economic summer green
- Economic winter red

Markets flow between both of these.

How do we know what season it is in?
- Rates of change
- GDP
- Industrial Production
- Paid services
- Dead market stress
- Unemployment

## Correlation

- The process of establishing a relationship or connection between two or more things.
- If bitcoin dumps, other crypto will dump too

## FOMO

- Emotions do not belong
- "fear of missing out"
- Everything is trying to get your attention and effect your emotions
- You don't chase after the plane, you find one that hasn't taken off yet.

## Supply and Demand

- The last cookie on the planet
- If the baker cooks more cookies, the last cookie is worth less now.
- Scarcity and quality
- Excessive supply has low demand

## Bull and Bear markets

- Bulls make money.. long trades here
- Bear lose money.. short trades here
- Don't be a bag holder, bring your money into the real world
- Keep and multiply your money

## Gamble Invest Trade Income

- It's easy to make money in a bull market
- Same thing as gambling
- Be a trader or an investor
- Traders spend time every day making smaller trades
- Investors don't have to watch the market every day
- Crypto is not a cash flow activity, it is a capital multiplication activity
- If you need cash-flow, you need to do something else

## Questions

- Quality of your questions is correlated to the quality of your life
- Giving people specific details
- Vagueness gets vague answers
- What have you already tried
- Tell them what you want to learn and why you want to learn it
- Never ask "Thoughts?"

What do good questions look like?

❌ Thoughts on XRP?
✅ Using the analysis taught in investing lesson #8, I believe XRP is a good buy. Here is my work... Did I apply the lessons correctly?

❌ Where do I go?
✅ I have searched channels 1, 2, 3 and cannot find this specific thing I'm looking for. Am I missing the map, or a recommended pathway diagram?

Ask questions:
> Specifically
> With all relevant details
> While keeping it short
