The four economic seasons.
- Economic summer green
- Economic winter red

Markets flow between both of these.

How do we know what season it is in?
- Rates of change
- GDP
- Industrial Production
- Paid services
- Dead market stress
- Unemployment

## Correlation

- The process of establishing a relationship or connection between two or more things.
- If bitcoin dumps, other crypto will dump too

## FOMO

- Emotions do not belong
- "fear of missing out"
- Everything is trying to get your attention and effect your emotions
- You don't chase after the plane, you find one that hasn't taken off yet.

## Supply and Demand

- The last cookie on the planet
- If the baker cooks more cookies, the last cookie is worth less now.
- Scarcity and quality
