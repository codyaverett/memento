# Fundamentals

Most people give up at the fundamental lessons.

Commit or just give up now

Anyone can make money using crypto, but some people get more benefit from it than others:

- Learn how to approach crypto at different wealth levels
- Capital (how much money I have now in savings)

People at different wealth levels can handle different levels of portfolio risk

Low Income / Low Savings
Medium Income / Medium Savings
High Income / High Savings

1. Long term investing using the advanced valuation models in daily analysis
   - Strategic dollar cost average when aggregate valuations are low.  Responsible profit taking when valuations are very high
	    - Very Effective
	    - Low time input
	    - Takes a long time to work (Years)
2. Develop your investing strategy by going through the investing masterclass & experienced lessons
		- Hard work and takes a considerable time commitment up front
		- After construction, the system is very low time input
		- Pain in the ass to create, but you OWN the underlying systems and have a full working understanding of how it operations
		- If the prof die or the signals are stopped you still have a way to make money using a great investing system
		- Works faster than long term investing.  More returns, lower risk.
3. Choice three is choice 2 without the work
   - Risk of failing without guidance
   - Signal Following
