# Trading Expectations

## Trading is NOT a Get-rich-quick Scheme!
If you try to get rich quick, you will go broke quickly! Even if you start out winning, itâ€™s only a matter of time until you lose everything. The markets will humble you. Take your time, study hard and practice good risk management!

## This Will Take Hard Work and Dedication!
If you have a small account, it will take you some time before you are able to trade full-time! Focus on honing your skills and gaining experience. Remember, the preservation of capital should be your #1 priority. The gains will come naturally if you focus on the preservation of capital!

## You Must Create a Strategy!
You will learn how to do that in our other course. Once you create your strategy, you must stick to it, and not only stick to it but execute without any emotion. You need to be a robot. Emotions will only get in the way of your success.
