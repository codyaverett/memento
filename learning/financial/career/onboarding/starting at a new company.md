# Starting at a New Company

Starting a new job can be overwhelming and challenging, but there are things you need to keep in mind when you are going through the process.

- Get to know who you will need to potentially interact during your work.  People are one of your greatest assets to knowing if you are working on the right thing and creating correct changes to the existing system.
- Get all the access you will need up front
- Get all the tools you may need installed and set up
- Understand what you can and cannot install on your system
- Get to know your teammates
	- What are their strengths and weaknesses
		- Where can you help them?
	- How can you maximize others to maximize your team throughput?
- Understand the business and terminology
- Make an operations dictionary to keep track of what you learn
- Understand what is expected of you
	- At first you will have negative velocity, but should aim to become neutral, and quickly become a net positive asset for your team and organization.
