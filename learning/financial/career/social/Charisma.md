## Day 1 - How to Make Other People Smile
- fun
- make other people feel good, lift other people up

### First Impressions
- Convey a vibe that makes people smile
- Be fun
- Crack a joke.. focus on your self

1. Being fun is positive
	1. Focus on what is good
	2. Be light hearted
	3. Don't give stock answers to questions

Charlie's brother introduced himself as "dragon"

I could introduce myself as "Cody the Coder", Hey I'm Cody, I was destined to write code and do Cody things.

Be one step more fun than the people around you.
A little more fun than everyone in the environment you ar in.

Don't try to fit in with the status quo

2. Condition yourself with things that make you laugh

Try to watch some funny movies.
Watch a short clip from "step brothers"
Hang out with your friends that tell more jokes.
Fun is making other people smile.
Smile whenever you meet a new person.

Tap into the part of yourself that is truly interested in where you are.

### Action Guide: Fun
Be better than good.

How are you? "I'm Stellar!"
Be better than good.

Set the trigger, imagine where you are going to be and who you are going to meet

Find a way to be exceptional

## Day 2

Make sure to introduce yourself with everyone with touch if there are less than 6 people.
Give a handshake 
Say hi
ask their name

Comfort will grow between you and the people you touch introduce yourself to.

## Day 3 - Generating Respect

Who are the people you respect?
- It's natural to respect someone that is a higher level than you (President, CEO, winners and achievers)
- Knowlege/Experts
- People that dress well

You probably won't be set up to generate this type of respect everywhere you go

But you could become a Leader and carry yourself in a manner that will help you earn that respect

Perfect your elevator speech!  And become more unique

1. Talk about the things you are passionate about 
	1. "What do you do?"
		   Do you mean what I do for a living, or what I do in my personal time?
	Be clear on your values
	I'm "Fun-employeed"
1.  What is it that you value

You are: The things that are important to you
You are NOT your job

Switch your actions and behaviors to match your values

### Getting to Know You Questions
- A playful first answer is very useful 
	- Doctor: "People pay me to cut them open"
	- Mechanic
- Trim the Logistics!
	- Focus on Values
- Sharing your values
- Add an element of mystery
	- If you don't add some mystery, people won't ask you questions
	- Talk about aspirations
