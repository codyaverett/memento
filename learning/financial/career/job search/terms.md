# Terms

Urgent - This means critical. As in, I need to fill a job immediately. Not in 3 months or 27 interviews.

Educated - This means smart, well read, trained, or experienced. It doesn’t necessarily mean a degree.

Experienced - This means that the candidate has knowledge of a certain function or industry. Or a track record of success. It does not mean a certain number of years or a certain number of jobs.

Competitive - This means the salary is attractive or comparable to market value. It does NOT mean underpaid or cheap.

Management - This means managing people. It’s not a title where you slap all kinds of unrelated responsibilities….and expect an employee to do the job of 2 or 3 people for 1 salary.

Synergy - This means nothing. If you see the word “synergy” in a job description, move on.

Family - These are people related to you. Work is not family. It’s a business arrangement. If you see the word family in a job description, it’s a dysfunctional one. At best.

Room for growth - This means opportunities to be promoted. Career planning and expected salary increases. It does not mean bigger pants because you are stress eating at your job.

Entry Level - This means no experience. It means your last job was playing beer pong and skipping class. It does not mean 2 years, 5 years or MBA required.
