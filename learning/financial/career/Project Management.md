# Project Management

**Product Manager (PM):**
- Focuses on the "what" and "why": What product features should be developed, and why are they valuable to users and the business?
- Drives product strategy and vision: Sets the long-term goals and direction for the product.
- Prioritizes features based on user needs, market research, and business goals.
- Works closely with cross-functional teams to ensure alignment and that the right product is being built.
- Acts as the advocate for the user and ensures that the product meets user needs.
- Balances short-term and long-term goals.

**Project Manager (PM):**
- Focuses on the "how" and "when": How will the project be executed, and when will specific tasks be completed?
- Manages the project's timeline, resources, and tasks.
- Ensures that the project stays on schedule and within scope.
- Frequently uses project management methodologies like Agile, Scrum, or Waterfall.
- Collaborates with various teams to coordinate project activities.
- Deals with the mechanics of task assignment, ticket tracking, and sprint management.

While there can be some overlap in responsibilities, especially in smaller teams or companies where dedicated project managers might not exist, the key distinction is that product managers are more focused on the product's overall strategy and vision, whereas project managers are concerned with the tactical execution and project delivery.

In some cases, product managers may end up taking on project management responsibilities when a dedicated project manager is not available, but it's not their primary role. Product managers are more oriented toward setting the direction and ensuring that the right product is being built to meet user needs and business goals.
