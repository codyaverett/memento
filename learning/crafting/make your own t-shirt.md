I'm adverse to going out and trying on new clothes.
Buying clothes has always been more of a chore for me and not extremely enjoyable.

- I never really understood fashion trends and following the trend likely wouldn't be easy to do when one isn't usually interested in shopping for new clothing.

My idea of motivation here is that, if I can make my own shirt, I would then be capable of trying to make more of my own clothes from materials and designs that I can find online.
