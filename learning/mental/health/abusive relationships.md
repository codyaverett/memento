# Abusive Relationships

There are many signs that a person may be in an abusive relationship. Some common indicators include:

- Physical abuse: This can include physical harm, such as hitting, punching, or choking, as well as threats of physical harm.

- Emotional abuse: This can include verbal abuse, such as insults, criticism, or name-calling, as well as manipulation or controlling behavior.

- Sexual abuse: This can include any sexual activity that is not consensual, including rape or coercion.

- Financial abuse: This can include controlling a person's access to money or resources, or using money or resources to control a person's behavior.

- Stalking: This can include following a person, showing up uninvited at their home or workplace, or monitoring their movements or activities.

If you or someone you know is experiencing any of these behaviors, it's important to seek help. Some options include reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, contacting a local domestic violence hotline, or seeking support from a mental health professional. Remember, you are not alone and there is help available.
