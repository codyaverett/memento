# Self-Fulfilling belief

Negative thoughts lead to negative outcomes.

You might unconsciously work to affirm your belief by 

- ignoring the positive through confirmation bias 
- amplifying the negative through selective attention
- and acting in ways that attract negativity towards you

e.g. "like snapping at your coworker or yelling at your partner"

This concept is what underlies the placebo effect, where beliefs shape the outcomes of medical treatment.

Think about what beliefs you hold 

- each morning when you wake up
- at work
- when you're faced with a challenging project
- or even when you question your self-worth

"If you don't believe you're worthy of happiness, you will struggle to find it"
