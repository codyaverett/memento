Thinking about negative stuff that happened in the past?
Thinking about things that could go wrong in the future?

e.g. "You had an awkward interaction with your manager.  And then, you can't stop thinking about every detail which makes you feel terrible. Then you worry about what your manager thinks about you, which makes you feel even worse"

If you catch yourself brooding, bring your thoughts back to awareness and ask.

1. Ask "Is this within my control?"
2. Then "What can I do about it?"
3. Then take action

Action in the present moment is the best antidote

[[Overthinking]]
