# Dealing with ADHD Symptoms

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a person's ability to focus, control impulses, and regulate behavior. It is typically treated with a combination of medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.

Medication: Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, are the most commonly prescribed medications for ADHD. They work by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which can help improve focus and attention. Non-stimulant medications, such as atomoxetine, can also be effective for treating ADHD.

Therapy: Psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be helpful for individuals with ADHD. CBT can teach individuals strategies for managing their symptoms and improving their functioning in daily life.

Lifestyle changes: Making changes to your daily routine and environment can also be beneficial for managing ADHD. This may include setting goals, creating a structured daily routine, using calendars and lists to stay organized, and reducing distractions. Exercise and a healthy diet can also be helpful in managing ADHD symptoms.

It's important to note that treatment for ADHD is typically most effective when it is tailored to the individual's specific needs and involves a combination of medication and therapy. It is also important to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan.
