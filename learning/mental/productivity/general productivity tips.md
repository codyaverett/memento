# General Productivity Tips

1. Ask people that are productive, what makes them productive
2. Always ask, "is this task essential?"
3. Don't put so much pressure on the future you.  The tomorrow you might not want to do the thing yesterday you said they were gonna do.
4. Optimize for what is fun.  Find ways to make it fun.
5. Create a routine, stick to the routine
6. Don't use your phone for the first 40mins-60mins a day
7. Try to be done with work by 5pm
8. Establish clear systems, create your own productivity systems
9. Management. Be clear about what we actually do. "How do we want to do this going forward?"
10. Don't fall back on defaults, defaults are usually the least common denominator. 
11. Don't be easily reachable, if you can be easily reached you will not be productive.
12. Ask how you get started until you get to a level where you can make the leap for the window
13. Be in control of when, why, and how you do things.
14. "I can't want this for you more than you want it for yourself"
15. Shake up, get peoples confidence up, put them in a situation where they can be more rewarded
16. Don't let people stay in a place where they are underperforming
17. Place people in a situation where they can introspect on themselves more objectively
18. Capture more data and metrics
19. If you are going to be late on a deliverable tell the stake holder before the due date
20. Things come and things go, you have to be able to accept that.  You are a part of a continuum where you will lose things.  Enjoy things and people while you have them.  Don't hold people back from their next thing.
