# How Do You Know Which Major and Minor Keys Go Together?

In Western music theory, major and minor keys are considered closely related if they share the same key signature, meaning they have the same number and types of sharps or flats in their scales. For example, the key of C major has no sharps or flats in its scale, while its relative minor key, A minor, also has no sharps or flats.

In addition to relative keys (major and minor keys that share the same key signature), there are also parallel keys, which share the same tonic (starting note) but have different key signatures. For example, the parallel minor key of C major is C minor, which has three flats in its scale.

Musicians often use chords from the relative major or minor key as a way of creating harmonic variety within a song or piece of music. For example, in a song in C major, a musician might use chords from the key of A minor, such as the Am or F chords, to add a different color or mood to the song.

In general, the choice of which major and minor keys to use together will depend on the specific musical context and the desired musical effect. However, knowing which keys are closely related and share similar characteristics can be a helpful starting point for making these choices.
